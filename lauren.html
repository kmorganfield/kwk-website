  <p>Hey guys, my name is Lauren and I am 14 years old! I coded for my 8th grade science fair project and I absolutely loved it! I prefer backend koding (you will learn what that means later) and I love Hamilton! My favorite moments of Kode with Klossy were making calculators and bringing our final project together!  I struggled to learn the command line, though. During camp, stay calm when you get frustrated. Getting angry only sets you back more, so don't panic when you don't understand things!  I hope you guys enjoy this as much as I did!! I also love <a href = "http://www.twitter.com/laurencrowe0" target="_blank" class="socialmedia"> Twitter</a> and <a href = "http://www.Instagram.com/lauren.crowe" target="_blank" class="socialmedia"> Instagram</a>!</p>
