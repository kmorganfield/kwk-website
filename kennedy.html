  <p>Welcome to Kode with Klossy from an STL Smart Kookie:)  I don't remember that last time I'd worked with HTML before camp started.  On top of that, I had no clue what Ruby was.  I can promise that you will learn a ton in this program!  Keep ALL your files so you can continue to build up your projects and grow as a koder beyond these two weeks.  Also, don't hide your strengths!  I personally discovered how well I navigate HTML and CSS.  Share what you have to offer and you will come across to everyone as both an cd  to a group and a potential friend.  I hope KWK is the highlight of your summer like it was for me.</p>
