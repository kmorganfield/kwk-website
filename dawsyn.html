    <p>Before attending the Kode with Klossy camp, I had no prior experience with coding. I came in nervous that I would be awful at coding and wouldn't understand it at all. But after going through the two week camp, I discovered I wasn't as bad as I thought I was. As the days went on, I became less mediocre. The other girls were very supportive and patient with explaining concepts to me. NEVER BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP! Most of the other girls are like you: they have little to no experience with coding. The other girls and the instructors are the biggest help you will get!</p>
